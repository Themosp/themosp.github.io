## Where do data come from?
- Data comes from Yahoo, through the R "getSymbols()" function.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(quantmod)
library(lattice)

    data<-getSymbols('^IXIC', src = "yahoo", 
               from = '2014-06-09',
               to = '2014-06-13',
               auto.assign = FALSE)
```

## What do the actual data look like?

```{r}
head(data)
```

The IXIC.Close column is what we are looking for.
